### üß† About Me

I am an iOS Mobile App Developer with experience in building apps using Swift and SwiftUI. I have worked with CoreBluetooth to connect with BLE devices, and used ARKit and RoomPlan to create AR features and scan rooms. I‚Äôve also worked with 3D models in iOS apps. My earlier experience with Android Studio and AI tools helped me improve my skills in app design, problem-solving, and understanding how apps work on different platforms. I enjoy creating easy-to-use and useful mobile apps.
